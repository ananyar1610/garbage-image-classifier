# Garbage Image Classification using Computer Vision  

## Overview  
This project applies computer vision and deep learning to classify images of waste into predefined categories such as **plastics, paper, glass, metals, and organic matter**.  

The goal is to support efficient waste management by automating the sorting process, reducing human error, and promoting sustainability.  

The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and fine-tuned on a garbage dataset. Architectures like **MobileNetV2** and **EfficientNetB0** are employed for lightweight yet accurate classification. A **Streamlit dashboard** is included to allow users to upload waste images and receive real-time predictions.

- Pre-processing pipeline with resizing, normalisation, and augmentation  
- Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetB0  
- Streamlit dashboard for interactive image upload and prediction  
- EDA visualisations including class distribution and sample images

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
The dataset consists of labelled images of waste divided into categories such as **plastics, paper, glass, metals, organic waste, and residual waste**.  
Images are collected under varied lighting, resolution, and backgrounds.  

**Split:**  
- Training set: 80%  
- Validation set: 20%  

If you donâ€™t have the dataset, you can use the [Garbage Classification Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

## ðŸ”Ž Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Class distribution** showed imbalance across categories (plastics and paper dominant).  
- **Sample visualisations** confirmed labelling quality but highlighted noise such as cluttered backgrounds.  
- **Image pre-processing** included resizing, normalisation, and augmentation (rotation, flips, zoom).  

EDA findings informed augmentation strategies and guided model selection for better robustness.

## ðŸ’» Streamlit Dashboard  

The project includes an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time garbage image classification. The dashboard provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can upload an image of waste and receive immediate predictions about its category.  

### ðŸš€ Key Features  
- **Image Upload**: Drag and drop or browse to upload an image.  
- **Real-Time Prediction**: The model classifies the image into categories such as plastics, paper, glass, metals, or organic matter.  
- **Visual Feedback**: The uploaded image is displayed alongside the predicted category.  
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Powered by transfer learning (MobileNetV2/EfficientNetB0).  

### ðŸ”§ Run Locally  
To launch the dashboard:  
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
